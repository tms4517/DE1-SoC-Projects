# DE1-SoC Projects
This repository contains simple projects that have been implemented to gain a
better understanding  of the architecture of the DE1-SoC board.

The RTL has been implemented in SystemVerilog.

The file `pin_mapping.txt` contains pin assignment information. Depending on the
project, the required pin assignment information can be appended to the .qsf
file.
